            <h4>Improved trust</h4>
            <p>
              For many customers, making a payment online is still seen as a
              risk and because of this they may have a preferred way to pay.
              Offering a range of different payment methods makes your service
              store appear more trustworthy, as you are taking the customers
              needs, preferences and security into consideration. When you
              provide multiple payment options it gives customers the green
              light to trust you. The more options you offer the more
              professionalism and legitimacy you show.

            <h4>Attract new customers</h4>
            <p>
              The best way to attract customers is to convey that your company
              uses traditional methods of payment processing, as well as
              embracing new technology to appeal to a new generation of
              customers. As a result, your business will not only continue to
              bring in service for your regular customers, but will attract new
              customers who choose to pay via certain payment methods, such as a
              smartphone, where card details may not be required or pay after
              delivery methods.

            <h4>More conversions</h4>
            <p>
              The biggest reason for offering multiple payment options is that
              it will help maximise your conversion rate. If you have a customer
              who wants to do business with you after they visit your site and
              add a product to their cart, then the last thing you want to do is
              put them off by only allowing a limited choice of payment methods.

            <h4>Reduced cart abandonment</h4>
            <p>
              Many customers will abandon a purchase if they are not able to pay
              in their preferred way. Offering a range of payment methods can
              reduce friction at the checkout process and encourages the
              customer to complete their transaction. Reducing cart abandonment
              can increase your conversion rate and revenue.{" "}
